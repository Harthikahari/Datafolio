# Datafolio
Welcome,  I've been working with data over the past five year. I'm creating this repository so I can share with the comunity my analysis and practice a bit of coding and creating machine learning models.  On this repository you may find classification and regression models and some EDAs (Exploratory Data Analysis) all implemented with python/R.  Hope you enjoy!
